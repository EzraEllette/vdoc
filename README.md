# vdoc README

This is vdoc, a documentation generator extension for VS Code. It currently supports JavaScript and TypeScript. I initially planned on supporting more languages, but I'm not sure if I'll have the time to do so. If you want to contribute, feel free to do so. I wouldn't recommend it as there are much better alternatives out there, but if you want to, go ahead.

## Features

Adds a command to the command palette to generate documentation for a function in the current file.

## Extension Settings
This extension contributes the following settings:

* `vdoc.apiKey`: API Key for OpenAI. You can get one [here](https://openai.com/).
**Enjoy!**
